# Uncertainty-relevance-task

In this project we analyze how human subjects navigate different kinds of uncertainties - sensory uncertainty, category uncertainty, and relevance of different stimuli. 

The files include both jupyter notebooks that can run code on local computers and python files that are used to parallel process data from multiple subjects on the cluster.
