# Uncertainty-relevance-task

In this project we analyze how human subjects navigate different kinds of real-life behavioral demands - sensory uncertainty, relevance of different stimuli and 
learning of short- and long-term statistics of the stimuli. 

The files include both jupyter notebooks that can run code on local computers and python files that are used to parallel process data from multiple subjects on the cluster. 

To reproduce figures the key files are: ComputingBiasInLongContextData_AndFiguresForPaper; 
Analyzing_online_data_script_NoContext; Analyzing_online_data_script_LongContext; 
Analyzing_online_data_script_ShortContext; GLManalysis_NoContext
